# ws-deck-builder
Project using Laravel and Bootstrap to replace the defunct wsdecks.com

Started as a personal project to refresh my Laravel skills and to test how quickly I can build a functioning website.

Due to reasons, I was never able to fully publicize this website. Not sure if it will be completed due to alternatives existing.

## To-Do
### Homepage
- [ ] Search by Title
- [ ] Search by Series

### Build (Neo-Standard)
- [ ] No deck name or description allowed. Make heuristic based on deck contents
- [ ] No images, list like HotC translation list
- [ ] Basee off "Cards" page with Ajax pagination

### Misc
- [ ] Edit page
- [ ] Print deck list
- [ ] Remove all images on site. Images must reference elsewhere.
